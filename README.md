# youtube-contraband

`ytc` for short, is a side project that I will be working on to learn about
data streaming, some AWS hosting, networking and learning some surface level stuff about ffmpeg and audio processing.

## Notes
I will be standing on the shoulders of giants that have created the insane python tool [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
as I am not smart enough to write my own Youtube video/audio scrapper.
